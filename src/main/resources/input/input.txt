I also encountered the same problem, download using (Download: https://download.docker.com/mac/beta/Docker.dmg) this
version of the mirror after it covers the local old version of the software, and then be able to skip Error warning
You can open the program settings page. Click uninstall to re-install just fine, and MacOS Sierra should be a relationship,
my system version is: 10.12.
Hope to help, thank you
